# The HEBench Organization

Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is considered by some to be the holy grail of cryptography. It allows for computation on encrypted data without needing to ever decrypt it throughout its entire lifecycle. However, due to the significant computational requirements, HE has only recently began to reach the stage where its potential can be realized. The HEBench Organization is aimed at providing the tools to assist in accelerating innovation in HE benchmarking to address the
lack of structured and consistent measurements of full stack performance.
